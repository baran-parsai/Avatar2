For simplicity put llm's here and then put symbolic links to them in the scenarios. Don't want to have too many copies of these around. Note that the llms are NOT encoded in the github repo, even as links. So in the scenario directory do a

ls -s /path/to/dolphin-2.7-mixtral-8x7b.Q4_K_M.gguf dolphin-2.7-mixtral-8x7b.Q4_K_M.gguf

in the scenario
