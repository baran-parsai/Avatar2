Create some object in the scene, add the Avatar script to it.
Ensure that the object has an audio source component.
Change the IP address in the Avatar to match your ROS2 world.

In the ROS2 world run rosbridge

Audio captured in the ROS world will be played out of the object you created in unity.

Avoid having your microphone and the output speaker listen to each other

The code has been updated recently to improve service call performance.
